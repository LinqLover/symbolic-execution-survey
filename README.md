A survey of literature and applications for symbolic execution tools.
Created in the [research seminar on Advanced Programming Tools](https://hpi.de/en/studies/during-your-studies/courses/it-systems-engineering-ma/course/wise-22-23-3658-advanced-programming-tools-_-fortgeschrittene-programmierwerkzeuge.html) conducted by [@hpi-swa-teaching](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching). Kindly advised by Patrick Rein ([@codeZeilen](https://github.com/codeZeilen)).

## Goals

Prepare a **presentation/lecture (1 h) followed by a discussion (30 min)** and a **written report (8 â€“ 12 pages).** See all details in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Artifacts

- **[Talk:](./talk/)** [Slide deck](./talk/Symbex.pdf) and demo materials (90 min, 105 slides, many colorful figures).
- **[Report:](./report)** Write-up of the survey ("Symbolic Execution and Applications", 26 pages, single-column).

  Abstract:
  
  > Symbolic execution is a dynamic program analysis technique that identifies and examines most execution paths of a program without requiring the programmer to specify inputs. We describe how symbolic execution works, give an overview of its uses and implications for vulnerability detection, testing, and program comprehension, and discuss its practicality and limitations.

- **[Examples:](./examples)** Some examples of different tools and applications for symbolic execution.
- **[Notes:](./notes)** All notes and memos from the literature research. Might be incomplete or outdated in parts.

Note that the latest and thus most up-to-date artifact is the **report** and the slide deck might go less in the depth.
