## General

### Suggested Approach

> 1. Initial reading
>    1. Use suggested sources to get an impression of the vocabulary and major themes.
>    2. Hint: Wikipedia is fair game to get an initial impression. Just don’t use it as an authoritative source.
> 2. Extended literature search and selection
>    1. Go for quantity first by using different databases and search terms (suggestion: ~30 sources).
>    2. Skim abstracts, conclusions, and intros to select good candidates (suggestion: ~5 sources).
>    3. You are looking for empirical accounts on tool usage, tutorials, tool designs, reviews, surveys. 
> 3. In-depth reading of selected sources
> 4. Answer prepared questions
> 5. Use the tool and prepare a demonstration
>    1. Search for tools via GitHub tags, Wikipedia lists, alternativeto.net, tool lists in books (or whatever works).
>    2. Take the answers to your prepared questions into account when selecting a scenario.
> 6. Reflect
>    1. Heavily depends on your topic.
>    2. Hints
>       1. Try explaining the tool to friends.
>       2. Try arguing against using the tool.
>       3. Compare it to similar tools.
> 7. Hints
>    1. Adapt and backtrack as needed.
>    2. **Take notes (include source)!**

### Contributions to Look For

> Contributions to look for while selecting papers:
>
> - Tool designs
>   - Illustrate the potential of the tool
>   - Illustrate commonalities between different designs of the same tool
> - Fine-grained empirical observations of tool usage
>   - Insights into actual benefits and pitfalls when using the tool
> - Large-scale empirical observations of tool usage
>   - Insights into actual usage in the field
> - Tutorials
>   - Illustrate interesting scenarios
>   - Introduce concepts and vocabulary
> - Evaluations
>   - Compare several tool instances
>   - Illustrate what is currently possible
>   - List relevant metrics
> - Surveys
>   - Can provide a ready-made taxonomy of the surrounding field
>   - Recent surveys relief you of the search phase
> - *Technical improvements*
>   - *Might help reflecting about the limitations (may briefly study implementation for this)*

### Content of Presentation/Report

> 1. Portrait the tool according to the following questions (at least):
>    1. During which software development activity would you apply the tool?
>    2. What does it optimize or make possible?
>    3. Which use cases does the tool cover
>    4. What indicates that the tool will be useful/applicable?
>    5. What are the defining features of the tool? What are additional features that are available on top of the main features?
>    6. What are the theoretical and practical limitations of the tool (size of artifacts, application domain, execution model, …)?
>    7. What are the trade-offs in comparison to other tools?
> 2. Demonstrate the tool with an actual use case. Either:
>    - One of your own projects
>    - A selected open-source project
> 3. Reflections on the tool and its usage
> 4. Further hints
>    1. Reference the sources for your claims about the tool!
>    2. Discuss the general tool, not a specific implementation.
>    3. Target Audience: Your fellow master-level students.
>    4. If the tool belongs to a larger category of tools, locate the tool within this larger category.
