## Execution Tree

Nodes are branch statements, edges are branches, labeled with executed statements up to next branch

## Execution-Generated Testing, EGT

## Godzilla

## KLEE

## Memory alias

## Path explosion

## Program path, execution path

Path in execution tree, represents equivalence class of inputs

## SMT solver, SAT solver

Decide whether an equation system can be solved and provide a concrete solution is possible. SAT = satisfiability; SMT = satisfiability modulo theory, also knows axioms for common data types

## Symbolic execution, symbolic evaluation, symbex
