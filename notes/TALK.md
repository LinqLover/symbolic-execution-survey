## Learning goals

After this class, students should:

- understand the basic concept of symbolic execution
- know common implementation approaches to symbolic execution
- be aware of common implementational forces and limitations to symbolic execution
- understand which problems are well-suited for symbolic execution and which are not
- have gotten an impression of the impact of symbolic execution in industry
  - (e.g., SAGE at Microsoft, coreutils bugs, ...)
- have heard of some practical state of the art tools that use symbolic execution
- have heard of some research directions that are currently pursued in symbolic execution
  - TODO: research further - e.g., scale out, more search heuristic, smt solver performance?

## Main question

What is symbolic execution and what is it (not) useful for?
